# 001 - Yii goal and values

## Goal

The Yii project goal is to build and maintain:

- Practical and helpful tools and community.

## Values

We share some common values that serves the goal.

- Being Practical
    - High Performance
    - Sensible Defaults and Flexibility / Convention over Configuration
    - Practice-orientation
- Being Helpful
    - Simplicity
    - Explicitness
    - Consistency

### High Performance

High performance is an innevitable element of being practical. We believe that software should perform efficiently in terms of both resource consumption and how fast one can achieve goals using it.

### Sensible Defaults and Flexibility / Convention over Configuration

We provide sensible defaults and conventions that one could customize via configuration.
That allows to achieve flexibility without sacrificing good practices and simplicity.

### Practice-orientation

We prefer practice over theory.

For example:

- Solutions for known use cases should not over-engineered for flexibility if practically there is no need for it.
- Standard implementations should take practical usage into account.
- Experiments are preferred to theories.

### Being Helpful

It applies both to the technical decisions and to the community. Community-wise we value any high quality contribution, be it a
pull request or an elaborative answer at the forum.

When the other principles could conflict, we choose a solution that is more helpful to the community.

### Simplicity

Solutions should be simple yet elegant:

- We add complexity where necessary and avoid it otherwise.
- We do not tolerate ugly solutions unless there is no other way.
- Less rules are better than more rules.

### Explicitness

We prefer explicit solutions and code.

For example:

- Straightforward solution is better than over-abstracted one. That is not an excuse not to abstract though.
- Typecasting is better than type coercion, type-hinting is better than no type hinting.
- No magic unless necessary.
- Loud fails are preferred to silent fails.

### Consistency

We try being consistent in everything:

- Code style.
- Naming.
- Design.
- Structure.
