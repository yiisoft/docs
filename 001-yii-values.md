# 001 - Yii goal and values

## Goal

The Yii project aims to build and maintain _practical_ and _helpful_ tools and community.

## Values

The values we express in our work support the goal. We try to

- Be Practical
    - [High Performance](#high-performance)
    - [Sensible Defaults and Flexibility](#sensible-defaults-and-flexibility)
    - [Be practice-oriented](#be-practice-oriented)
- Be Helpful
    - [Be simple](#simplicity)
    - [Be explicit](#explicitness)
    - [Be consistent](#consistency)
    
## Be Practical

### High Performance

Performance is a necessary condition of practicality. Software should not waste machine or human resources.

### Sensible Defaults and Flexibility

We prefer sensible defaults and conventions that users can customize. We seek a balance between flexibility, discipline and simplicity that meets common needs.

### Be practice-oriented

We prefer practice over theory. For example:

- Solutions for known use cases should avoid excess complexity by providing only needed flexibility.
- Standard implementations should take practical use into account.
- Experience is at least as useful as theory in guiding design.
- Context is critical in determining appropriateness.

## Be Helpful

This value guides technical decisions as well as community activity. Consideration of how software features help users should guide development. Community-wise, we value any helpful contribution, be it a
pull request or an answer in the forum.

When the other principles could conflict, we choose a solution that is more helpful to the community.

### Be Simple

Solutions should be simple and expressive:

- We use as much complexity as needed and no more.
- We avoid ugly solutions unless there is no alternative.
- Fewer rules are better than more rules.

### Be Explicit

We prefer explicit, obvious solutions and code. Solutions should clearly express exactly what they do. For example:

- A straightforward solution is better than an abstract one unless the abstraction has practical purpose.
- Loud fails are better than silent fails or masking errors.
- Explicit casts are better than PHP type juggling, type hints are good.
- No magic unless necessary.

### Be consistent

We try to be consistent in:

- Code style
- Naming
- Design
- Structure
- Values and goals
