# 001 â€” Yii goal and values

## Goal

The Yii project aims to build and support _practical_ and _helpful_ tools and community.

## Values

The values we express in our work support the goal. We try to

- Be practical
    - [High performance](#high-performance)
    - [Sensible defaults and flexibility](#sensible-defaults-and-flexibility)
    - [Be practice-oriented](#be-practice-oriented)
- Be helpful
    - [Be simple](#be-simple)
    - [Be explicit](#be-explicit)
    - [Be consistent](#be-consistent)
    
## Be practical

### High performance

Performance is a necessary condition of practicality. Software shouldn't waste machine resources or human resources.

### Sensible defaults and flexibility

We prefer sensible defaults and conventions that users can customize.
We seek a balance between flexibility, discipline and simplicity that meets common needs.

### Be practice-oriented

We prefer practice to theory. For example:

- Solutions for known use cases should avoid excess complexity by providing only necessary flexibility.
- Standard implementations should take practical use into account.
- Experience is at least as useful as theory in guiding design.
- Context is critical in determining appropriateness.

## Be helpful

This value guides technical decisions as well as community activity.
Consideration of how software features help users should guide development.
Community-wise, we value any helpful contribution, be it a pull request or an answer in the forum.

When the other principles conflict, we choose a solution that's more helpful to the community.

### Be simple

Solutions should be simple and expressive:

- We use as much complexity as needed and no more.
- We avoid ugly solutions unless there is no alternative.
- Fewer rules are better than more rules.

### Be Explicit

We prefer explicit, obvious solutions and code. Solutions should clearly express exactly what they do. For example:

- A straightforward solution is better than an abstract one unless the abstraction has a practical purpose.
- Loud fails are better than silent fails or masking errors.
- Explicit casts are better than PHP type juggling, type hints are good.
- No magic unless necessary.

### Be consistent

We try to be consistent in:

- Code style
- Naming
- Design
- Structure
- Values and goals
