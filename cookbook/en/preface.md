# Preface

Yii is a high-performance, package-based PHP framework for developing modern applications.
The name Yii (pronounced `Yee` or `[ji:]`) means "simple and evolutionary" in Chinese.
You can also think about it as an acronym for **Yes It Is**!

Yii is a generic Web programming framework.
You can use it for developing all kinds of Web applications using PHP.
Because of its architecture and sophisticated caching support,
it's especially suitable for developing large-scale applications such as portals, content management systems,
e-commerce, REST APIs, etc.

With comprehensive documentation and an enthusiastic user community, Yii can significantly reduce your development time in the long run.
