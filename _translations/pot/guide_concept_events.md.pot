"For example, when a user is signed up, you need to send a welcome email. You "
"can do it right in the `SignupService` but then, when you additionally need "
"to resize user's avatar image, you'll have to change `SignupService` code "
"again. In other words, `SignupService` will be coupled to both code sending "
"welcome email and code resizing avatar image."
