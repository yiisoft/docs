"  Yii will never try to over-design things mainly to follow some design patterns.\n"
"- Yii extensively uses PSR interfaces with the ability to reuse what PHP community created and even\n"
"  replace core implementations if needed.\n"
"- Yii is both a set of libraries and a full-stack framework providing many proven and ready-to-use features:\n"
"  caching, logging, template engine, data abstraction, development tools, code generation, and more.\n"
"- Yii is extensible. You can customize or replace every piece of the core's code. You can also\n"
"  take advantage of Yii's solid architecture to use or develop redistributable packages.\n"
"- High performance is always a primary goal of Yii.\n"
