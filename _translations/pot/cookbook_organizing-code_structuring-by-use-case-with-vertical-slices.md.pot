"When building an application, it's important to organize the code in a way "
"that makes it easy to understand, support, and scale. One popular approach "
"is to structure the code by use-case with vertical slices."

msgid ""
"Vertical slices are self-contained pieces of functionality that cover the "
"entire stack, from the user interface to the data access layer.  Developer "
"organizes each slice around a specific use case, such as creating a new user "
"or updating a product."

"When structuring code classically by type (such as models, views, "
"controllers, helpers, etc.), it can be easy to lose sight of the bigger "
"picture and how different pieces of code interact to support specific "
"features or use cases.  This can lead to code duplication, tight coupling, "
"and poor maintainability as the application grows."

"On the other hand, structuring code by use-case makes developers focus on a "
"specific feature or workflow and understand how different pieces of code "
"work together to support that feature. This approach also helps to keep "
"related code together in a single directory, making it easier to navigate "
"and support. Vertical slicing also encourages the use of domain-driven "
"design concepts, such as entities, repositories, and services, which can "
"help to promote good separation of concerns and modularity."

"Additionally, structuring code by use-case can make it easier to test and "
"debug the application since use-case namespace encapsulates each feature or "
"workflow in its own directory with clear boundaries and well-defined "
"interfaces."
