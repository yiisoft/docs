"Caching is an inexpensive and effective way to improve the performance of an "
"application.  By storing relatively static data in cache and serving it from "
"cache when requested, the application saves the time that it otherwise would "
"require to generate the data from scratch every time."

"Caching can occur at different levels and places in an application. On the "
"server-side, at the lower level, cache may be used to store basic data, such "
"as a list of most recent article information fetched from the database; and "
"at the higher level, cache may be used to store fragments or whole of Web "
"pages, such as the rendering result of the most recent articles. On the "
"client-side, you may use HTTP caching to keep most recently visited page "
"content in the browser cache."
