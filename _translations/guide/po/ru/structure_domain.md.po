"in mind (the problem context), you build an abstraction that consists of entities, their relationships, and logic that\n"
"operates these entities. To focus on the complex part of the problem, domain is, ideally, separated from\n"
" the infrastructure part of the system (that's how to save data into a database, how to form HTTP response, etc.).\n"
