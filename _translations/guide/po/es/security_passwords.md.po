msgid "Most developers know that passwords can't be stored in plain text, but many developers believe it's still safe to hash passwords using `md5`, `sha1` or `sha256` etc. There was a time when using the aforementioned hashing algorithms was enough, but modern hardware makes it possible to reverse such hashes and even stronger ones using brute force attacks."

msgid "To offer increased security for user passwords, even in the worst case scenario (when one breaches your application), you need to use a hashing algorithm that's resilient against brute force attacks.  The best current choice is `argon2`.  Yii `yiisoft/security` package make securely generate and verify hashes easier and ensure the best possible hashing solution used."
