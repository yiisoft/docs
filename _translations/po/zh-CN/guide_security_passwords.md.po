"Most developers know that passwords can't be stored in plain text, but many "
"developers believe it's still safe to hash passwords using `md5`, `sha1` or "
"`sha256` etc. There was a time when using the aforementioned hashing "
"algorithms was enough, but modern hardware makes it possible to reverse such "
"hashes and even stronger ones using brute force attacks."

"To offer increased security for user passwords, even in the worst case "
"scenario (when one breaches your application), you need to use a hashing "
"algorithm that's resilient against brute force attacks.  The best current "
"choice is `argon2`.  Yii `yiisoft/security` package make securely generate "
"and verify hashes easier and ensure the best possible hashing solution used."
