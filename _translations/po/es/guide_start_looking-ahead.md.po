msgid "If you've read through the entire \"Getting Started\" chapter, you have now created a complete Yii application.  In the process, you've learned how to implement some commonly necessary features, such as getting data from users via an HTML form, fetching data from a database, and displaying data in a paginated fashion. You've also learned how to use [Gii](gii.md) to generate code automatically. Using Gii for code generation turns the bulk of your Web development process into a task as simple as just filling out some forms."
