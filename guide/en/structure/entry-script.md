# Entry scripts

Entry scripts are the first step in the application bootstrapping process. An application (either
Web application or console application) has a single entry script. End users make requests to
entry scripts which instantiate application instances and forward the requests to them.

Entry scripts for Web applications must be stored under Web accessible directories so that they
can be accessed by end users. They're often named as `index.php`, but can also use any other names,
provided Web servers can locate them.

Entry script for console application is `./yii`.

Entry scripts mainly perform the following work with the help of `ApplicationRunner`:

* Register [Composer autoloader](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading);
* Obtain configuration;
* Use configuration to initialize dependency injection container;
* Get an instance of request.
* Pass it to `Application` to handle and get a response from it.
* With the help of emitter that transforms response object into actual HTTP response that's sent to client browser.

## Web Applications <span id="web-applications"></span>

The following is the code in the entry script for the application template:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use App\ApplicationRunner;

// PHP built-in server routing.
if (PHP_SAPI === 'cli-server') {
    // Serve static files as is.
    if (is_file(__DIR__ . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])) {
        return false;
    }

    // Explicitly set for URLs with dot.
    $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] = '/index.php';
}

require_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$runner = new ApplicationRunner();
// Development mode:
$runner->debug();
// Run application:
$runner->run();
```


## Console Applications <span id="console-applications"></span>

Similarly, the following is the code for the entry script of a console application:

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Yiisoft\Config\Config;
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;
use Yiisoft\Yii\Console\Application;
use Yiisoft\Yii\Console\Output\ConsoleBufferedOutput;

define('YII_ENV', getenv('env') ?: 'production');

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$config = new Config(
    __DIR__,
    '/config/packages',
);

$containerConfig = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDefinitions($config->get('console'))
    ->withProviders($config->get('providers-console'));
$container = new Container($containerConfig);

/** @var ContainerInterface $container */
$container = $container->get(ContainerInterface::class);

$application = $container->get(Application::class);
$exitCode = 1;

try {
    $application->start();
    $exitCode = $application->run(null, new ConsoleBufferedOutput());
} catch (\Error $error) {
    $application->renderThrowable($error, new ConsoleBufferedOutput());
} finally {
    $application->shutdown($exitCode);
    exit($exitCode);
}
```

## Alternative runtimes

For alternative runtimes such as RoadRunner or Swoole, special entry scripts should be used. See:

- [Using Yii with RoadRunner](../tutorial/using-yii-with-roadrunner.md)
- [Using Yii with Swoole](../tutorial/using-yii-with-swoole.md)
