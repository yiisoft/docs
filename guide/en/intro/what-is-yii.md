# What is Yii

Yii is a high performance, component-based PHP framework for rapidly developing modern Web applications.
The name Yii (pronounced `Yee` or `[ji:]`) means "simple and evolutionary" in Chinese. It can also
be thought of as an acronym for **Yes It Is**!


## What is Yii Best for?

Yii is a generic Web programming framework. It can be used for developing all kinds
of Web applications using PHP. Because of its component-based architecture and sophisticated caching
support, it is especially suitable for developing large-scale applications such as portals, forums, content
management systems (CMS), e-commerce projects, RESTful Web services, and so on.


## How does Yii Compare with Other Frameworks?

If you're already familiar with another framework, you may appreciate knowing how Yii compares:

- Yii takes the [philosophy of being practical and helpful](https://github.com/yiisoft/docs/blob/master/001-yii-values.md) achieving:
  - Performance in both development and execution.
  - Convenient customizable defaults.
  - Practice-orientation.
  - Simplicity.
  - Explicitness.
  - Consistency.
  
  Yii will never try to over-design things mainly for the purpose of strictly following
  some design patterns.
- Yii extensively uses PSR interfaces with ability to reuse what PHP community created and even
  replace core implementations if needed.
- Yii is both a set of libraries and a full-stack framework providing many proven and ready-to-use features:
  caching, logging, template engine, data abstraction, development tools, code generation; and more.
- Yii is extremely extensible. You can customize or replace nearly every piece of the core's code. You can also
  take advantage of Yii's solid architecture to use or develop redistributable packages.
- High performance is always a primary goal of Yii.

Yii is backed up by a [strong core developer team](http://www.yiiframework.com/team/) financially backed from an
[OpenCollective foundation](https://opencollective.com/yiisoft), as well as a large community of professionals constantly
contributing to Yii's development. The Yii developer team keeps a close eye on the latest Web development trends and
on the best practices and features found in other frameworks and projects. The most relevant best practices and features
found elsewhere are regularly incorporated into the core framework and exposed via simple and elegant interfaces.


## Yii Versions

Yii currently has three major versions available: 1.1, 2.0 and 3.0.

- Version 1.1 is the old generation and is now in security fixes only mode.
- Version 2.0 is current stable version that is in the feature freeze bugfix mode.
- Version 3.0 is the current version in development. This guide is mainly about version 3.


## Requirements and Prerequisites

Yii3 requires PHP 8.0 or above, but some packages also support PHP 7.4.

Using Yii requires basic knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP), as Yii is a pure OOP-based framework.
Yii3 also makes use of the latest features of PHP, such as type declarations and generators. Understanding these
concepts will help you more easily pick up Yii3.
