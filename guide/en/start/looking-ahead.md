# Looking Ahead

If you've read through the entire "Getting Started" chapter, you have now created a complete Yii application.
In the process, you've learned how to implement some commonly needed features, such as getting data from users
via an HTML form, fetching data from a database, and displaying data in a paginated fashion. You've also learned how
to use [Gii](gii.md) to generate code automatically. Using Gii for code generation turns the bulk of your Web development
process into a task as simple as just filling out some forms. 

This section will summarize the Yii resources available to help you be more productive when using the framework.

* Documentation
    - [The Definitive Guide](../README.md):
      As the name indicates, the guide precisely defines how Yii should work and provides general guidance
      about using Yii. It's the single most important Yii tutorial, and one you should read 
      before writing any Yii code.
    - The Class Reference (to be available later):
      This specifies the usage of every class provided by Yii. It should be mainly used when you're writing
      code and want to understand the usage of a particular class, method, property. Usage of the class reference
      is the best only after a contextual understanding of the entire framework.
    - [The Wiki Articles](https://www.yiiframework.com/wiki?version=all&tag=yii3):
      The wiki articles are written by Yii users based on their own experiences. Most of them are written
      like cookbook recipes, and show how to solve particular problems using Yii. While the quality of these
      articles mayn't be as good as the Definitive Guide, they're useful in that they cover broader topics
      and can often provide ready-to-use solutions.
    - [Books](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/)
* [Extensions](https://www.yiiframework.com/extensions/):
  Yii boasts a library of thousands of user-contributed extensions that can be easily plugged into your applications,
  thereby making your application development even faster and easier.
