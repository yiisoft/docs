# What do you need to know?

The Yii learning curve isn't as steep as other PHP frameworks, but still, there are some things you should learn before
starting with Yii.

## PHP

Yii is a PHP framework, so make sure you [read and understand language reference](https://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php).

## Object-oriented programming

You need a basic understanding of object-oriented programming. If you're not familiar with it, check one of the many
tutorials available such as [the one from tuts+](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/object-oriented-php-for-beginners--net-12762).

When you develop with Yii, you write code in an object-oriented fashion, so make sure you're familiar with
[PHP OOP support](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php).

Note that the more complicated your application is, the more advanced OOP concepts you should learn to successfully
manage that complexity.

## Command line and Composer

Yii extensively uses the de-facto standard PHP package manager, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) so make sure you read
and understand its [guide](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md). If you aren't familiar with using
the command line, it's time to start trying. Once you learn the basics, you'll never want to work without it.

## HTTP

Since Yii is a web framework and the web largely uses HTTP, it's a good idea to
[learn more about it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP).

## Docker

The default application template leverages Docker,
so we recommend that you [read and understand the concepts](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

Also, you will benefit from familiarizing yourself with [twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/) principles.
