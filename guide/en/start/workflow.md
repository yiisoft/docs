# Running Applications

After installing Yii, you have a working Yii application that can be accessed via
the URL `http://hostname/`. This section will introduce the application's built-in functionality,
how the code is organized, and how the application handles requests in general.

> Info: For simplicity, throughout this "Getting Started" tutorial, it's assumed that you have set `app/public`
  as the document root of your Web server, and configured the URL for accessing
  your application to be `http://hostname/index.php` or something similar.
  For your needs, please adjust the URLs in our descriptions accordingly.
  
Note that unlike the framework itself, after the project template is installed, it is all yours. You're free to add or delete
code and overall modify it as you need.


## Functionality <span id="functionality"></span>

The application installed contains four pages:

* the homepage, displayed when you access the URL `http://hostname/index.php`,
* the "About" page,
* the "Contact" page, which displays a contact form that allows end-users to contact you via email,
* and the "Login" page, which displays a login form that can be used to authenticate end-users. Try logging in
  with "admin/admin", and you will find the "Login" main menu item will change to "Logout".

These pages share a common header and footer. The header contains the main menu bar to allow navigation
among different pages.

You should also see a toolbar at the bottom of the browser window.
This is a useful [debugger tool](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii-debug) provided by Yii to record and display a lot of
debugging information, such as log messages, response statuses, the database queries run, and so on.

Additionally, to the web application, there is a console script called `yii`, which is located in the applications base directory.
This script can be used to run background and maintenance tasks for the application, which are described
in the [Console Application Section](../tutorial/console.md).


## Application Structure <span id="application-structure"></span>

The most important directories and files in your application are (assuming the application's root directory is `app`):

```
app/                    application base path
    composer.json       used by Composer, describes package information
    config/             contains application and other configurations
        console.php     the console application container configuration
        web.php         the Web application container configuration
    src/                source code root
        Command/            contains console command classes
        Controller/         contains controller classes
        Factory/            contains container factories simplifying creation of complicated services
    runtime/            contains files generated by Yii during runtime, such as logs and cache files
    vendor/             contains the installed Composer packages, including the Yii framework itself
        bin/
             yii        the Yii console command execution script
    views/              contains view files
    public/                application Web root, contains Web accessible files
        assets/         contains published asset files (javascript and css) by Yii
        index.php       the entry (or bootstrap) script for the application
```

In general, the files in the application can be divided into two types: those under `app/public` and those
under other directories. The former can be directly accessed via HTTP (i.e., in a browser), while the latter can not and should not be.

The following diagram shows the static structure of an application.

![Static Structure of Application](images/application-structure.png)

Each application has an entry script `public/index.php` which is the only Web accessible PHP script in the application.
The entry script is creating an instance an incoming request with the help of one of PSR-7 packages
and passes it to [application](structure-applications.md) instance. An application contains a set of
middleware that are executed sequentially processing the request. The result is passed further to emitter
that takes care of sending a response to the browser.

Depending on the middleware used, the application may behave differently. By default, there is a router
that, based on URL requested and configuration, chooses a handler that is executed to produce a response.


## Request Lifecycle <span id="request-lifecycle"></span>

The following diagram shows how an application handles a request.

![Request Lifecycle](images/request-lifecycle.png)

1. A user makes a request to the [entry script](structure/entry-script.md) `public/index.php`.
2. The entry script loads the container configuration [configuration](concept/configuration.md) and creates
   an [application](structure/application.md) instance to handle the request.
3. Application is starting to execute middleware configured. One of these is typically a router.
4. Router finds out what handler to execute based on request and configuration.
5. The handler may load some data, possibly from a database.
6. The handler forms a response by using data. Either directly or with the help of the view package.
7. The response is passed to the emitter that takes care of sending the response to the user's browser.
