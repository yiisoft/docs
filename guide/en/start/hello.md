# Saying hello

> Note: This document reflects the current configuration. The Yii team is going to make it simpler before release.

This section describes how to create a new "Hello" page in your application.
It's a simple page that will echo back whatever you pass to it or, if nothing passed, will just say "Hello!".

To achieve this goal, you will define a route and create [a handler](../structure/handler.md) that does the job and
forms the response.
Then you will improve it to use [view](../structure/views.md) for building the response.

Through this tutorial, you will learn three things:

1. How to create a handler to respond to request.
2. How to map URL to the handler.
3. How to create a [view](../structure/view.md) to compose the response's content.

## Creating a Handler <span id="creating-handler"></span>

For the "Hello" task, you will create a `EchoController` class with `say` method that reads
a `message` parameter from the request and displays that message back to the user. If the request
doesn't provide a `message` parameter, the action will display the default "Hello" message.

Create `src/Controller/EchoController.php`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Controller;

use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Yiisoft\Html\Html;

class EchoController
{  
    private ResponseFactoryInterface $responseFactory;

    public function __construct(ResponseFactoryInterface $responseFactory)
    {
        $this->responseFactory = $responseFactory;
    }

    public function say(ServerRequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface
    {
        $message = $request->getAttribute('message', 'Hello!');

        $response = $this->responseFactory->createResponse();
        $response->getBody()->write('The message is: ' . Html::encode($message));
        return $response;
    }
}
```

The `say` method in your example is given `$request` parameter that you can use to obtain
a message, whose value defaults to `"Hello"` (in 
the same way you set a default value for any function or method argument in PHP). When the application
receives a request and determines that the `say` action is responsible for handling said request, the application will
populate this parameter with the same named parameter found in the request. In other words, if the request includes
a `message` parameter with a value of `"Goodbye"`, the `$message` variable within the action will be assigned that value.

The response returned goes through [middleware stack](../structure/middleware.md) into emitter that outputs response
to the end user.

## Configuring router

Now, to map your handler to URL, you need to add a route in `config/routes.php`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use App\Controller\EchoController;
use App\Controller\SiteController;
use Yiisoft\Router\Route;

return [
    Route::get('/')->action([SiteController::class, 'index'])->name('home'),
    Route::get('/say[/{message}]')->action([EchoController::class, 'say'])->name('echo/say'),
];
```

In the above you're mapping `/say[/{message}]` pattern to `EchoController::say()`. For a request its instance will
be created and `say()` method will be called. The pattern `{message}` part means that anything specified in this place
will be written to `message` request attribute. `[]` means that this part of the pattern is optional. 

You also give a `echo/say` name to this route to be able to generate URLs pointing to it.

## Trying it out <span id="trying-it-out"></span>

After creating the action and the view, start a web server with `./yii serve` and follow the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/say/Hello+World
```

This URL will result in a page displaying "The message is: Hello World".

If you omit the `message` parameter in the URL, you would see the page display "The message is: Hello!".

## Creating a View Template <span id="creating-view-template"></span>

Usually, the task is more complicated than printing out "hello world" and involves rendering some complex
HTML. For this task, it's handy to use [views templates](../structure/view.md). They're scripts you
write to generate a response's body.

For the "Hello" task, create a `/resources/views/echo/say.php` view that prints the `message` parameter received
from the action method:

```php
<?php
use Yiisoft\Html\Html;
/* @var string $message */
?>

<p>The message is: <?= Html::encode($message) ?></p>
```

Note that in the above code, the `message` parameter is HTML-encoded
before being printed. This is necessary as the parameter comes from an end user, making it vulnerable to
[cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) by embedding
malicious JavaScript in the parameter.

Naturally, you may put more content in the `say` view. The content can consist of HTML tags, plain text, and even
PHP statements. In fact, the `say` view is a PHP script that's executed by the view service.

To use the view you need to change `src/Controller/EchoController.php`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Controller;

use Yiisoft\Yii\View\ViewRenderer;
use Yiisoft\Router\CurrentRoute;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

class EchoController
{
    private ViewRenderer $viewRenderer;
    
    public function __construct(ViewRenderer $viewRenderer)
    {
        $this->viewRenderer = $viewRenderer->withControllerName('echo');
    }

    public function say(CurrentRoute $route): ResponseInterface
    {
        $message = $route->getArgument('message', 'Hello!');

        return $this->viewRenderer->render('say', [
            'message' => $message,
        ]);
    }
}
```

Now open your browser and check it again. It should give you similar text but with a layout applied.

Also, you've separated the part about how it works and part of how it's presented. In the larger applications, 
it helps a lot to deal with complexity.

## Summary <span id="summary"></span>

In this section, you've touched the handler and view parts of the typical web application.
You created a handler as part of a class to handle a specific request. You also created a view
to compose the response's content. In this simple example, no data source was involved as the only data used was
the `message` parameter.

You've also learned about routing in Yii, which acts as the bridge between user requests and handlers.

In the next section, you will learn how to fetch data, and add a new page containing an HTML form.
