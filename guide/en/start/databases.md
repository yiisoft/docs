# Working with Databases

Yii doesn't dictate using a particular database or storage for your application.
There are many ways you can work with relational databases:

- [PDO](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php)
- [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/)
- [Cycle](https://github.com/cycle)

For non-relational ones, there are usually official libraries available:

- [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/clients/#php)
- ...

Out of the box, Yii provides [an integration package for Cycle ORM](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii-cycle).
