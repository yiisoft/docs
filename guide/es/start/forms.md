# Working with forms

This section continues to improve on "Saying Hello." Instead of using URL,
you will now ask a user for a message via form.

Through this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* Create a form model to represent the data entered by a user through a
  form.
* Declare rules to validate the data entered.
* Build an HTML form in a view.

## Installing form package

To install form package, issue the following command in your application
directory:

```
composer require yiisoft/form-model
```

For Docker that would be:

```
make composer require yiisoft/form-model
```

## Creating a form <span id="creating-form"></span>

The data to be requested from the user will be represented by a `Form` class
as shown below and saved in the file `/src/App/Controller/Echo/Form.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controller\Echo;

use Yiisoft\FormModel\FormModel;
use Yiisoft\Validator\Label;
use Yiisoft\Validator\Rule\Length;

final class Form extends FormModel
{
    #[Label('The message to be echoed')]
    #[Length(min: 2)]
    public string $message = '';
}
```

In the above example, the `Form` has a single string property `$message`
which length should be at least of two characters. There's also a custom
label for the property.

## Using the form <span id="using-form"></span> 

Now that you have a form, use it in your action from "[Saying
Hello](hello.md)".

Here's what you end up with in `/src/Controller/Echo/Action.php`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Controller\Echo;

use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Yiisoft\FormModel\FormHydrator;
use Yiisoft\Yii\View\Renderer\ViewRenderer;

final readonly class Action
{
    public function __construct(
        private ViewRenderer $viewRenderer,
        private FormHydrator $formHydrator,
    ) {}

    public function __invoke(ServerRequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface
    {
        $form = new Form();        

        $this->formHydrator->populateFromPostAndValidate($form, $request);

        return $this->viewRenderer->render(__DIR__ . '/template', [
            'form' => $form,
        ]);
    }
}
```

Instead of reading from route, you fill your form from request's POST data
and validate it with the help of `FormHydrator`. Next you pass the form to
the view.

For the form to function we need to allow both GET to render the form and
POST to send the data.  Adjust your route in `config/common/routes.php`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Yiisoft\Http\Method;
use Yiisoft\Router\Group;
use Yiisoft\Router\Route;

return [
    Group::create()
        ->routes(
            Route::get('/')
                ->action(\App\Controller\HomePage\Action::class)
                ->name('home'),
            Route::methods([Method::GET, Method::POST], '/say')
                ->action(\App\Controller\Echo\Action::class)
                ->name('echo/say'),
        ),
];
```

## Adjusting view

To render a form, you need to change your view,
`src/Controller/Echo/template.php`:

```php
<?php
use App\Controller\Echo\Form;
use Yiisoft\FormModel\Field;
use Yiisoft\Html\Html;
use Yiisoft\Router\UrlGeneratorInterface;
use Yiisoft\Yii\View\Renderer\Csrf;

/**
 * @var Form $form
 * @var string[] $errors
 * @var UrlGeneratorInterface $urlGenerator
 * @var Csrf $csrf
 */

$htmlForm = Html::form()
    ->post($urlGenerator->generate('echo/say'))
    ->csrf($csrf);
?>

<?= $htmlForm->open() ?>
    <?= Field::text($form, 'message')->required() ?>
    <?= Html::submitButton('Say') ?>
<?= $htmlForm->close() ?>

<?php if ($form->isValid()): ?>
    Echo said: <?= Html::encode($form->message) ?>
<?php endif ?>
```

If the form is valid, you display a message. The rest initializes and
renders the form.

First, you initialize `$htmlForm` with the POST type and the action URL
generated with the help from the URL generator.  You can access it as
`$urlGenerator` in all views. You also need to pass the CSRF token to the
form, which is also available in every view as `$csrf` thanks to the view
injections listed in `config/common/params.php`:

```php
'yiisoft/yii-view-renderer' => [
    'injections' => [
        Reference::to(CsrfViewInjection::class),
    ],
],
```

The template renders the CSRF token value as a hidden input to ensure that
the request originates from the form page and not from another website. It
will be submitted along with POST form data. Omitting it would result in
[HTTP response code 422](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.2).

You use `Field::text()` to output "message" field, so it takes care about
filling the value, escaping it, rendering field label and validation errors.

Now, in case you submit an empty message, you will get a validation error:
"The message to be echoed must contain at least 2 characters."

## Trying it Out <span id="trying-it-out"></span>

To see how it works, use your browser to access the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/say
```

You will see a page with a form input field and a label that indicates what
data to enter.  Also, the form has a "submit" button labeled "Say". If you
click the "submit" button without entering anything, you will see that the
field is required. If you enter a single character, the form displays an
error message next to the problematic input field.

After you enter a valid message and click the "submit" button, the page
echoes the data that you entered.

## Summary <span id="summary"></span>

In this section of the guide, you've learned how to create a form model
class to represent the user data and validate said data.

You've also learned how to get data from users and how to display data back
in the browser.  This is a task that could take you a lot of time when
developing an application, but Yii provides powerful widgets to make this
task easy.

In the next section, you will learn how to work with databases, which are
needed in nearly every application.
