# Security

Good security is vital to the health and success of any application. Unfortunately, many developers cut corners when it
comes to security, either due to a lack of understanding or because implementation is too much of a hurdle. To make your
Yii powered application as secure as possible, Yii has included several excellent and easy to use security features.

* [Authentication](authentication.md)
* [Authorization](authorization.md)
* [Working with Passwords](passwords.md)
* [Cryptography](cryptography.md)
* [Best Practices](best-practices.md)
* [Trusted request](trusted-request.md)

* [Views security](../views/view.md#security)
