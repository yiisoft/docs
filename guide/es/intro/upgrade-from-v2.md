# Upgrading from Version 2.0

> If you haven't used Yii 2 you can safely skip this section and get directly to "[getting started](../start/installation.md)"
> section.

While sharing some common ideas and values Yii 3 is conceptually different from Yii 2. There is no easy upgrade
path so first [check maintenance policy and end of life dates for Yii 2](https://www.yiiframework.com/release-cycle)
and consider starting new projects on Yii 3 while keeping existing ones on Yii 2.

## PHP requirements

Yii 3 requires PHP 7.4 or above. As a result, there are language features used that were not used in Yii 2:

- [Type declarations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration)
- [Return type declarations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.returning-values.php#functions.returning-values.type-declaration)
- [Class constant visibility](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.constants.php)
- [Anonymous classes](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.anonymous.php)
- [::class](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.basic.php#language.oop5.basic.class.class)
- [Generators](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.generators.php)
- [Variadic functions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.variable-arg-list)

## Preliminary refactoring

It is a good idea to refactor your Yii 2 project prior to porting it to Yii 3. That would both make porting easier
and benefit the project in question while it's not moved to Yii 3 yet.

### Use DI instead of service locator

Since Yii 3 is forcing you to inject dependencies properly, it is a good idea to prepare and switch from using
service locator (`Yii::$app->`) to [DI container](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/concept-di-container).

If usage of DI container is problematic for whatever reason, consider moving all calls to `Yii::$app->` to controller
actions and widgets and passing dependencies manually from controller to what needs them.

See [Dependency injection and container](../concept/di-container.md) for explanation of the concept.

### Introduce repositories for getting data

Since Active Record is not the only way to work with database in Yii 3, consider introducing repositories that would
hide details of getting data and gather them in a single place you can later re-do: 

```php
class PostRepository
{
    public function getArchive()
    {
        // ...
    }
    
    public function getTop10ForFrontPage()
    {
        // ...
    }

}
```

### Separate domain layer from infrastructure

In case you have rich complicated domain, it is a good idea to separate it from infrastructure provided by framework i.e.
all the business logic has to go to framework-independent classes.

### Move more into components

Yii 3 services are conceptually similar to Yii 2 components so it's a good idea to move reusable parts of your application
into components.
