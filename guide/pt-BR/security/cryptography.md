# Cryptography

In this section we'll review the following security aspects:

- Generating random data
- Encryption and Decryption
- Confirming Data Integrity

To use these features, you need to install `yiisoft/security` package:

```
composer install yiisoft/security
```

## Generating pseudorandom data

Pseudorandom data are useful in many situations. For example, when resetting a password via email, you need to generate a
token, save it to the database, and send it via email to end user which in turn will allow them to prove ownership of
that account. It's important that this token be unique and hard to guess, else there is a possibility that an attacker 
can predict the token's value and reset the user's password.

`\Yiisoft\Security\Random` makes generating pseudorandom data simple:

```php
$key = \Yiisoft\Security\Random::string(42);
```

Code above would give you a random string consisting of 42 characters.

If you need bytes or integers, use PHP functions directly:

- `random_bytes()` for bytes. Note that output may not be ASCII.
- `random_int()` for integers.

## Encryption and Decryption

Yii provides convenient helper functions to encrypt/decrypt data using a secret key.
The data are passed through the encryption function so that only the person which has the secret key will be able
to decrypt it.
For example, you need to store some information in your database, but you need to make sure only
the user who has the secret key can view it (even if one compromises the application database):

```php
$encryptedData = (new \Yiisoft\Security\Crypt())->encryptByPassword($data, $password);

// save data to database or another storage
saveData($encryptedData);
```

Decrypting it:

```php
// obtain encrypted data from a database or another storage
$encryptedData = getEncryptedData();

$data = (new \Yiisoft\Security\Crypt())->decryptByPassword($encryptedData, $password);
```

You could use a key instead of password:

```php
$encryptedData = (new \Yiisoft\Security\Crypt())->encryptByKey($data, $key);

// save data to database or another storage
saveData($encryptedData);
```

Decrypting it:

```php
// obtain encrypted data from a database or another storage
$encryptedData = getEncryptedData();

$data = (new \Yiisoft\Security\Crypt())->decryptByKey($encryptedData, $key);
```

## Confirming data integrity

There are situations in which you need to verify that your data haven't been tampered with by a third party or even
corrupted in some way. Yii provides a way to confirm data integrity by MAC signing.

The `$key` should be present at both sending and receiving sides. On the sending side:

```php
$signedMessage = (new \Yiisoft\Security\Mac())->sign($message, $key);

sendMessage($signedMessage);
```

At the receiving side:

```php
$signedMessage = receiveMessage($signedMessage);

try {
    $message = (new \Yiisoft\Security\Mac())->getMessage($signedMessage, $key);
} catch (\Yiisoft\Security\DataIsTamperedException $e) {
    // data is tampered
}
```

## Masking token length

Masking a token helps to mitigate BREACH attack by randomizing how token outputted on each request.
A random mask applied to the token making the string always unique.

To mask a token:

```php
$maskedToken = \Yiisoft\Security\TokenMask::apply($token);
```

To get original value from the masked one:

```php
$token = \Yiisoft\Security\TokenMask::remove($maskedToken);
```
