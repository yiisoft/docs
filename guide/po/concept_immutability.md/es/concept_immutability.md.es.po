msgid "Immutability means an object's state cannot change after it has been created.  Instead of modifying an instance, you create a new instance with the desired changes.  This approach is common for value objects such as Money, IDs, and DTOs. It helps to avoid accidental side effects: methods cannot silently change shared state, which makes code easier to reason about."
