# 019 - View code style

The PHP code in the view files should not be complicated. The code must contain the logic responsible for formatting the data, but not request this data.

## Renderers

Renderers are classes that render view files. 

All methods of these classes that are used inside view files must be public, even if they are not used anywhere other than view files.
