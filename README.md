This repository contains source and translations for the official documentation for Yii3 Framework,
a high-performance PHP framework for building modern web applications.

Rendered version could be viewed at [https://yiisoft.github.io/docs/](https://yiisoft.github.io/docs/).

Documentation is logically divided into three big pieces:

- The Definitive Guide, under the `src/guide` which contains primary documentation about using Yii3 as a whole.
- Community Cookbook, under `src/cookbook` which contains various recipes like "how to do X with Yii3".
- Internals, under `src/internals` which are Yii3 team guidelines that are useful to check if you want to understand
  framework more or contribute to it.

Additionally, there are translations under `src/{language code}` for multiple languages. These should not be edited
directly.

## Contributing
