# 014 - Documentation

Documentation is one of the most important parts of Yii.

## Package documentation

Documentation for a package could either be in `README.md` or `docs/{language}/{type}` where `{language}` is
a language code and `{type}` could be "guide", "cookbook" or something else.
Usually `docs` is there if the package usage or configuration is not trivial or there's a need for translation.

Some indicators that it is time to create `docs`:

1. Need for translation.
2. Existence of multiple separate topics each of these is big by itself.

If the total length of readme is less than about 200 lines, it is fine to keep documentation in the readme.

## Definitive guide

The definitive guide, [yiisoft/docs/guide](https://github.com/yiisoft/docs/tree/master/guide/en)
aims at covering usage of packages as a whole framework. Unlike package documentation, it is not
focused on a single package but is covering certain use-cases.

The guide should follow [Microsoft style guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

## PHPDoc

PHPDoc must not be added if it does not add anything to what it describes. The following is a bad example:

```php
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;

/**
 * MyService class
 */
final class MyService extends MyServiceBase
{
    /**
     * @var LoggerInterface logger 
     */
    private LoggerInterface $logger;

    /**
     * MyService constructor.
     * @param LoggerInterface $logger
     */
    public function __construct(LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $this->logger = $logger;
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function doit(): bool
    {
        return parent::doit();    
    }
}
``` 

PHPDoc, if present, should describe the purpose of the element it is added for.

## Readme checklist

Each package readme should be placed into `README.md` and contain the following:

- [ ] Logo.
- [ ] Short description of the package. What does it do?
- [ ] Quality badges (build, code coverage).
- [ ] Screenshot (if applicable).
- [ ] Requirements.
- [ ] Installation. Usually `composer require`.
- [ ] Getting started. One or two common usage examples demonstrated.
- [ ] Configuration.
- [ ] Contributing. Should contain a link to guidelines.
- [ ] Running tests.
- [ ] License.
